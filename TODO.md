# Things to do

Here is my list of todoes for the project.

## High level features to add

- User authentication and authorization
  - Persistent progress tracking for users
  - Admin role and interface for quiz creation
- Detailed quiz results and reporting
- Review data structures for JSON
- Consider a Quiz model as a collection of Category models

## Todo tasks

- [x] Update vscode launch to use `gunicorn` if it makes sense

- [x] Koyeb hosted deployment working with `gunicorn`

---

- [ ] Update Question data struct to use "list of index values" to correct answer in options list
  - This enables multi-choice questions
  - It reduces size of JSON file
  - check_answers() will need revising

---

- [ ] Design a Quiz model as a collection of Category models
  - Allows for categories of questions like certification exam groupings
  - [CCSP Outline](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/ccsp/ccsp-certification-exam-outline)
    - CCSP Examination Information - Quiz needs total duration, number of total questions, passing score
    - CCSP Examination Weights - list of domains/categories, and percentages or counts of questions for each domain

---

- [ ] Look into Github Projects to manage this TODO list and requirements
- [ ] [Github Projects Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects)
- [ ] Roadmap for longer term features

---

- [ ] Look into Github Copilot for \$10 a month or \$100 a year
  - [ ] Free Github Copilot with limitation make this easier to try out

---

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add an overview of the Quick Quiz app for end-users in a webpage
  - [ ] Add inline the FAQ.md to the overview page
  - [ ] Turn README.md, TODO.md and FAQ.md into Flask routed webpages for application documentation
  - [ ] [Rendering markdown from Flask](https://dev.to/mrprofessor/rendering-markdown-from-flask-1l41)
  - [ ] Add a link that renders the FAQ.md as a HTML webpage or add inline to the Doc page
  - [ ] Add CHANGES.md and maybe ROADMAP.md file

---

- [ ] Make the "Correct: Yes/No" either red or green and bold in the submitQuiz() function in quiz.html
- [ ] Break the edit_question.html page into two parts so we can paginate the Existing Questions section
- [ ] Add library dependency checkers to the Github repository
  - [x] Dependabot - Python pip requirements.txt
  - [x] Dependabot - Github Actions workflows
  - [ ] Javascript CDN (JS libraries)

- [ ] Add Markdown support for the Questions fields
  - [ ] [How To Use Python-Markdown with Flask and SQLite](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-python-markdown-with-flask-and-sqlite)
  - [ ] [Flask-Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Markdown/) adds support for Markdown to your Flask application.
  - [ ] MathJAX extension would do the scientific things like "`H<sub>2</sub>O`" for water
- [ ] Images or diagrams for questions missing (probably not going to do this)
  - [ ] Markdown would improve this. A separate field that is optional.
  - [ ] I have not thought this thru... how to save the image binary?!?
- [ ] PyTest for unittests and webapp automated testing
  - [ ] Simple test of each route with even `curl` would be useful
  - [ ] Simple tests of routes with parameters
  - [ ] Steal from [Django CI](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/django.yml) for Flask CI Tests
  - [ ] [Python App CI](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/python-app.yml) for Flake8 and Pytest

  - [ ] Look at undoing the above `base.html` to `default.html` change
  - [ ] Look into bootstrap schemes for different colors
  - [ ] Dig into how to cache the JS/CSS files in root static directory
  - [ ] Python Module [Bootstrap-Flask](https://github.com/helloflask/bootstrap-flask) makes version updates to BS5 trackable by Dependabot

    - [ ] [Deploy a Flask application on Koyeb](https://github.com/koyeb/example-flask)
    - [ ] [Deploy a Python Flask App](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/deploy/flask)
    - [ ] My bad on deployment likely due to missing `gunicorn` not needed by Ploomber
  - [ ] Ploomber is what I'm using right now
    - [ ] Has a Github Actions CICD option
    - [ ] Runs for 8 hours before stopping for inactivity - maybe ping self app to keep alive?
    - [ ] Two web apps limit on the free tier
    - [ ] No MySQL that I've found
    - [ ] app.py must be in the webroot or deployment fails... wow was that painful to learn

    - [ ] Idle apps are stopped:	After 4 hours of inactivity
    - [ ] Idle apps are removed:	After 1 week of inactivity
