## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature
request as a new Issue. Please look at the [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for additional known issues,
possible solutions and challenges.

For help and questions about using this project, please checkout the [README.md](README.md) for
more information about the application. We will likely add a **USAGE.md** at some point for
end-user support for using the Quick Quiz application.

## BDFL

The Project will have a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), who is currently Michael McGarrah
(@mcgarrah). As Dictator, the BDFL has the authority to make all final decisions for The Project.
To ensure the benevolence of the BDFL, The Project encourages others to fork the project if they
disagree with the overall direction the BDFL is taking. That why I chose the [GPLv3 LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Support Policy  

Support for Quick Quiz is limited to the resources listed above.
